## Coding Challenge: Dogs API 

### Challenge Description

Create a simple React application that utilizes the Dogs.CEO API to display random dog images. The application should have the following features:

1. Display random dog images fetched from the Dogs.CEO API on page load.
2. Include a button labeled "Fetch New Dogs" that, when clicked, fetches and displays new random dog images with a maximum of 20 images.
3. Make sure to handle errors gracefully, such as when the API is down or returns an error response.
4. Ensure that the UI is clean and user-friendly.

### Requirements

- Use React to build the application.
- Utilize the Dogs.CEO API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to fetch random dog images.
- You can use any additional libraries or frameworks as needed.
- Ensure that the code is well-structured, clean, and follows best practices.
- Provide comments where necessary to explain your code

### Bonus (Optional)

- Implement loading spinners to indicate when the images are being fetched.
- Add CSS styling to make the application visually appealing.
- Add a dropdown menu with a list of dog breeds (including sub breeds). When a user selects a breed from the dropdown, display a random image of that specific breed.
